# Rate of Change

- kinda self explanatory, rate of change is how fast something is changing
	- more specifically, how fast the dependent variable changes when the independent variable changes
	- it's the slope 
## Average velocity
$\frac{change\,in\,position}{change\,in\,time}$
i probably don't have to elaborate further 

equation is 
$$
\frac{\Delta s}{\Delta t}=\frac{s(a+h)-s(a)}{h}
$$
this is kinda overly complicated ngl
it's just difference in position over time

easier to understand equation:
$$
\begin{align}
&=\frac{y_2-y_1}{x_2-x_1}\\
&=\frac{f(x+h)-f(x)}{(x+h)-x}\\
&=\frac{f(x+h)-f(x)}{h}
\end{align}
$$
so obviously $y=f(x)$, and we can represent $y_2=f(x_2)$ 
$x_2$ is just $x_1$ + an arbitrary number, which we represent with $h$. 
we can then replace every $x_2$ with $x+h$ 
simplify and voila

now back to the velocity one
$$
\frac{\Delta s}{\Delta t}=\frac{s(a+h)-s(a)}{h}
$$
so s(a) is f(x) here. s is a function of position in relation to time.
so s=position, a=time, t is also time or something
h is again the arbitrary number between 2 points

## Why do we have this arbitrary number
$$\frac{f(x+h)-f(x)}{h}$$
so if we remember how to get iroc, we find aroc in between 2 points at a really really small distance apart. with the power of limits, we can actually get the iroc.

$$\lim_{h\to0}\,\frac{f(x+h)-f(x)}{h}$$
## Instantaneous velocity
this is just the IROC at a point of function. s(t) is the instantaneous velocity at t = a to t=a+h

$$v(a)=\lim_{h\to0}\,\frac{s(a+h)-s(a)}{h}$$
v(a) is the velocity at a time
s(a) is the position at a time
a is time
h is an arbitrary number
