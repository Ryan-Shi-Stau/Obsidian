- Jesus' Sermon on the Mount contains the heart of jesus' ethical message
- Basically the summary of the gospel
- to understand how we can interpret jesus' teachings for us today, we need important tools
	- exegesis 
	- hermeneutics
- exegesis is the study of scripture texts in their original context
	- looks at language, historical context, traditions, and other existing writings that influenced the authors of the texts
- hermeneutics is the task of interpretation
	- when we intrepret something we do so with reference to something else
	- matthrew wrote in an era different from our own
	- we must identify key lenses through which we read scripture
		- e.g. apocalyptic literature, kingdom of god
