- Don't waste your brainspace on worrying about your mark right after a test
	- discuss about it when you get it back 
	- what's done is done
	- **the less worrying and stress you have the better the work you do**
- bring a watch to your tests
	- nice to be able to track time yourself
- bring water to your tests
	- being hydrated makes you do better
