Vectors can be used to represent any type of measurement

whether numerical or diagrammatic, both can be manipulated mathematically

vector arrow is a diagrammatic abstract representation of a vector measurement which contains both magnitude and a direction.

Vectors can be added or subtracted algebraically only when the event takes place in 1 dimension

Vector diagrams are needed when an event occurs in 2D space with 4 directions

VECTOR ARROWS ARE NEEDED TO COMPLETE COMPUTATIONS IN 2D PLANES 
INTEGER SYSTEM CAN NO LONGER MODEL THE NUMBER OF POSSIBLE DIRECTIONS

## Rules for Vector Addition

When adding vectors, place the vector arrows tip to tail. 
Resultant vector $\vec{c}$ is drawn from the tail of $\vec a$ to the tip of $\vec b$ 

## Rules for Vector Subtraction

Place vector arrows tail to tail

determining direction is not as simple as addition since A-B is not the same as B-A

Direction is not at first intuitive since A-B vs B-A have the identical diagram

Consider the most common calculation that makes use of subtraction (Delta operation $\Delta$ )
let $\vec{v}$ be any vector
where $\vec{v_2}-\vec{v_1}=\vec{\Delta v}$ (finds the change between the final and initial state)
$\vec{A}-\vec{B}=\vec{C}$
$\therefore\vec{A}=\vec{C}+\vec{B}$ 

4 types of vector problems
1. 1D vectors with 2 or more given vectors
2. 2d vectors, right angle triangle with 2 given vectors
3. 2d vectors, right angle triangle with 3 or more given vectors (more than 2 perpendicular vectors)
4. 2d vector, non right angle triangle with 2 or more given vectors

- Use algebraic method
- KEY: draw it lmao
