Vectors can be used to represent any type of measurement

whether numerical or diagrammatic, both can be manipulated mathematically

vector arrow is a diagrammatic abstract representation of a vector measurement which contains both magnitude and a direction.

Vectors can be added or subtracted algebraically only when the event takes place in 1 dimension

Vector diagrams are needed when an event occurs in 2D space with 4 directions

VECTOR ARROWS ARE NEEDED TO COMPLETE COMPUTATIONS IN 2D PLANES 
INTEGER SYSTEM CAN NO LONGER MODEL THE NUMBER OF POSSIBLE DIRECTIONS

## Rules for Vector Addition

When adding vectors, place the vector arrows tip to tail. 
Resultant vector $\vec{c}$ is drawn from the tail of $\vec a$ to the tip of $\vec b$
