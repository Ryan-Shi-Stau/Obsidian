# Constants in physics

Constants in physics are calculated as the slope of the linear regression that defines the linear relationship between the two variables. They tell you exactly how to manipulate one variable in order to the other. They allow us to turn our proportionality statements into equations.

if $y\,\alpha\, x^n$
then $y=kx^n$

k is the scope of $y$ vs $x^n$ 
	
$$\begin{align}&Ek=\frac{mv^2}{2}\\&v=\sqrt{\frac{2Ek}{m}}\\&m=\end{align}$$
