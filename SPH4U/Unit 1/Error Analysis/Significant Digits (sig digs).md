# Significant Digits

* measurements describe physical world
* how do we know if it's correct
	* truth in numbers vs truth in words
	* we have to consider the language of numbers and how it conveys information
* system of numbers is made from 10 digits 0-9 (base 10)
	* how are we certain that it contains information
	* 1-9 are digits that express the presence of a countable object
	* **zero (0)** is the important number in sig fig
## sig digs rules 
rules for determining SDs revolve around zero
1. all non-zero numbers are **significant**
   rules for determining SDs revolve around 0
2. all trailing and leading zeroes are **insignificant**
	- 100m is the count 100x1m units, or 1x100m units
	- 0.05L only possible to guess that the smallest available unit was 0.01 unit and there were 5 of them
	- #### SDs represent the accuracy of the measuring instrument
	scientific notation was designed to eliminate these zeroes
		either $5\times10^2$ or $5\,e2$ will be used

3. all zeroes between SDs are **Significant**
4. all zeroes that come after a decimal placed SD, they are significant
	- 1.30 has 3 SDs
	- 1.3 has 2 SDs
	- therefore the 1.30 measurement is made with a device more accurate than one that recorded 1.3
### common sense when learning to carry SD through calculations
1. always assume you have LESS information and base final report on that
2. add+sub are the same operation, therefore they have same rules. mult/div as well.

| report final answer as the measurement in the calculation with the fewest SD | report final answer with least decimal places |
