# Unit Analysis

In Physics: Any multiplication/division operation **creates new units**

In a simplistic sense, Unit Analysis is the fact that since measurements are treated as numbers, we can define a value by looking for information in these measurements.

**Make sure you put the right unit**

Almost all units can be broken down into 3 fundamental units
Mass, Length, Time

Systeme Internationale (SI) is who standardizes units (SI units)

In classical mechanics, these units represent the basic types of measurements

So far we can read data provided in an observation table, next step in lab after obtaining info is analysis.

the "purest" form of data for a lab generally exists in your observation table/as raw data

we want to avoid introducing error into our data
