Essentially two types of datasets we will collect

1. average data set
	- all of the points are almost the same
	- repeated measurements of the same event/object
	- used to determine average value
2. graphable data set
	- clear trend
	- measure once per trial, each trial has changing variables
	- usually graphed to use graphical analysis to determine relationship between two variables

om data graphs, what goes on the x/y axis is more governed by what the units generate for the slope or area of a graph since this produces useful new measurements for the system

from a practical point of view, what is an independent vs dependent variable in an experiment?

An Independent Variable is the variable that is controlled by the experimenter 
A Dependent Variable is the variable that is measured by the experimenter 

In science, the IV/DP can be on any axis

therefore error analysis for these two data sets differ

an average data set inherently contains information of how uncertain a group of measurements that are supposed to be identical are when we compare them back to their average

precise data set is a data set where points are close to each other

## Standard deviation
- method used to determine uncertainty for an average data set because this type of data set shows inherent uncertainty in the set of values, since the values should theoretically all be the same'
-  $Xa=average\,of\,any\,measurement=\frac{x_1+x_2...+x_n}{n}$
- $\sigma=standard\,deviation$ (deviation of the average
- $$\sigma=\sqrt\frac{(x_a-x_1)^2+...+(x_a-x_n)^2}{n}$$
- Gets the average of how far off every entry is from the average

## regression
- used to create equations
