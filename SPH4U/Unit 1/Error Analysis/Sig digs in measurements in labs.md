how to determine the # of SD to represent if you are the experimenter recording

Mechanism of action: tell a story about how it works
Observational fact: kinda self explanatory ngl

**Certain digit:** measuring tool has gradations/markers for that placeholder that are countable

**Uncertain digit:** measuring tool doesn't posses a marker for that digit (forced to read between lines)

this is just a rule of thumb, experimenters need to apply common sense

consider conditions of measurement when thinking about SDs 


## DROP UNCERTAIN DIGITS

for raw data: uncertainty reported in data tables have to make sense
