# Properties of Limits

$\lim_{x\to a}f(x)=L$ means that the values of $f(x)$ become closer and closer to L as x gets closer and closer to a from either side of a, without ever actually becoming a. 

Sometimes when we substitute the x value, the y value is undefined. we need to use different strategies to determine if a limit exists since a limit can exist even if the point is undefined for that value of x

1. factoring 
2. rationalizing
3. substitution

properties of limits
1. $\lim_{x\to a}k=k$ for any constant $k$  (a limit of a constant is the constant itself)
2. $\lim_{x\to a}x=a$
