# Slope of a tangent

Tangent: line segment drawn to a figure that touches only one point
Secant: line segment drawn to a figure that intersects it in 2 points

slope of the tangent is IROC (instantaneous rate of change)
slope of the secant is AROC (average rate of change)

slope m of a line joining point P$(x_1,y_1)$ and Q$(x_2,y_2)$ 
$$m=\frac{\Delta y}{\Delta x}=\frac{y_2-y_1}{x_2-x_1}$$

equation of a line joining those two points is 

| Slope-intercept form | Point-slope form   |
| -------------------- | ------------------ |
| $$y=mx+b$$           | $$y-y_1=m(x-x_1)$$ |
## calculating slope of tangent
- kinda hard to calculate slope of tangent 
## calculating limits
if the limit exists
$$
\lim_{h\to0}\frac{f(a+h)-f(a)}{h}
$$
- h is the horizontal distance from point a to point a+h
	- as h approaches 0, it becomes closer and closer to the IROC
