# Continuity

A function is continuous at a point when the graph passes through the point without a break. 
A function is discontinuous at a point when the graph has a break of some type.
A graph that is discontinuous at a point has a break of some type at the point. 

- function f is continuous at x=a if 
	- f(a) is defined
	- $\lim_{x\to a}f(x)$ exists
	- $\lim_{x\to a}f(x)=f(a)$
- just test these 3 rules
- easy way is if you can draw the entire function without lifting your pencil off the paper, it's continuous
