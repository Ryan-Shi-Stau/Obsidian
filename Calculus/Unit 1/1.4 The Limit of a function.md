# The Limit of a Function

The notation $$\lim_{x\to a}f(x)=L$$ is read as "the limit of f(x) as x approaches a equals L"

This means that the value of f(x) can be made arbitrarily close to L by choosing a number x sufficiently close to a, but not equal to a. the limit exists if and only if the limiting value from the left equals the limiting value from the right. 


## How to find the limit of f(x) as x approaches a number

### table of values
create IROC table of values like in advanced functions

| x    | 1.9 | 1.99 | 1.999 | 2                         | 2.001 | 2.01 | 2.1 |
| ---- | --- | ---- | ----- | ------------------------- | ----- | ---- | --- |
| f(x) | 4.9 | 4.99 | 4.999 | don't fill this square in | 5.001 | 5.01 | 5.1 |
if we take a look at the table both sides approach 5, so the limit is 5

fancy notation time
$$
	\because \lim_{x\to2^-}f(x)=\lim_{x\to2^+} 
$$
the limit exists

(because the limit of f(x) when x approaches 2 from the left is equal to the limit of f(x) when x approaches 2 from the right, the limit exists)


### graphically

graph the function then use your eyes lmao

# Main takeaways
the limit of f(x) is L if $\lim_{x\to2^-}f(x)=\lim_{x\to2^+}$, otherwise it doesn't exist

$$
\begin{align}
\lim_{h\to0}&=IROC\\
\lim_{x\to a}f(x)&=y\,value\,at\,point\,a
\end{align}
$$
