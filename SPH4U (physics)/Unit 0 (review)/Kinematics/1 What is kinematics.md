## Kinematics: The study of motion

- From a measurement point of view, it mathematically relates length and time measurements
- Basically reverse calculating force and energy using length and time 
- When matter interacts with force and energy, this can cause motion/mechanical movement 
- $\therefore$ the ability to measure motion and measure motion and to define it mathematically allows us to form the basis for defining force/energy
- in physics, energy is a mathematical construct

We will start with graphical analysis of kinematics

vocab to use when analyzing graphs:

| Increasing | Decreasing     |
| ---------- | -------------- |
| Constantly | Non-constantly |
| Positively | Negatively     |
| Constant   | Zero           |
| Positive   | Negative       |
#### Which parts of a graph contain useful info that we want to analyze? 
1. [[Y axis Analysis|Y Axis]]
2. Slope (Derivative)
	1. say it's increasing constantly and whether it's pos/neg
3. Area (Area under curve/integrals in calculus)
	1. if it's under the x axis it's negative, if over it's positive
	2. only areas in the form of a rectangle are increasing constantly. everything else is increasing non-constantly 
	3. area always increases for each individual section
	4. area under the graph means the portion of the graph bounded by the trendline and x axis
